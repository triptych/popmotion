## Features

* **Render batching:** Prevents layout thrashing and unnecessary renders by batching all UI changes once per frame.
* **Individual transform props:** Set and animate `transform` props independently from one another.
* **Easy SVG transforms:** Replaces the complex SVG transform model with the user-friendly CSS equivalent.
* **Path drawing:** Set `path` length and offset as a percentage, simplifying the 'drawing' effect.
* **Scrolling:** `scrollTop` and `scrollLeft` support for the viewport and HTML elements.
* **Vendor prefixes:** Tests and detects rules for prefixed support.
* **Tiny:** At 3.5kb, it's the perfect fit for any animation library or website.
