# How to Contribute

This guide will run through the types of contributions you can make and how to set the Popmotion repo up, ready for local development.

## Types of Contribution

### Bugs

Open issues can be found on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Popmotion/popmotion/issues) page.

If you begin working on a bug, post your intent on the issue itself. This will prevent more than one person tackling a bug at once.

If the bug you wish to work on doesn't currently have an issue, make one and label it "Bug".

### Features

Before adding any features, open a Feature Proposal as a [new issue](https://github.com/Popmotion/popmotion/issues).

This will let us talk through your proposed API and/or implementation before you spend time on it.

## Development

Follow these steps to get your code PR-ready:

1. [Fork the Popmotion repo](https://github.com/Popmotion/popmotion).
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Run `yarn` and `yarn bootstrap` in the repo root ([install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) if necessary).
4. Add your code and supporting tests.
5. If this is a feature that requires doc changes, make as necessary.
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
7. Ensure your changes build by running `yarn build` in the appropriate package directory(s).

## Codebase Overview

Other than [Stylefire](https://github.com/popmotion/stylefire) and [Framesync](https://github.com/popmotion/framesync), Popmotion is a monorepo. All Popmotion and Pose packages are contained in the [`packages` directory](https://github.com/Popmotion/popmotion/tree/master/packages).

All code and tests must be written in Typescript.

### Package Hierarchy

This flowchart illustrates the Popmotion package dependency tree.

**Note:** Currently, this illustration depicts `popmotion` as **not** dependent on `stylefire`, which isn't currently true. In `popmotion@9.0.0`, I'm considering removing Stylefire as a Popmotion dependency.
